 * Created by nbagde on 7/23/2018.
 * 2) Find a triplet a, b, c such that a2 = b2 + c2.
 * Variations of this problem like find a triplet with sum equal to 0.
 * Find a pair with given sum.
 * All such questions are efficiently solved using hashing.
 *
 * Given an array of integers, write a function that returns true if there is a triplet (a, b, c) that satisfies a2 + b2 = c2.
 * Example:
 Input: arr[] = {3, 1, 4, 6, 5}
 Output: True
 There is a Pythagorean triplet (3, 4, 5).

 Input: arr[] = {10, 4, 6, 12, 5}
 Output: False
 There is no Pythagorean triplet.
